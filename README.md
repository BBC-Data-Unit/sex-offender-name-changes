In March 2023, we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-64624921) hundreds of sex offenders across the UK had slipped off the radar of police in a three-year period.

Freedom of Information requests to 45 police forces revealed 729 sex offenders had gone missing or were wanted for arrest from 2019-2021.

Abuse survivors had called on the government to introduce a new law to ban sex offenders changing their names.

The Home Office said it had "some of the toughest powers in the world to deal with sex offenders".

Calling the situation a scandal, MP Sarah Champion said the key reason so many offenders went missing was because they had changed their names.

When our report was published, MPs were due to discuss the issue the following day in a Backbench Business Debate in a House of Commons Chamber. 

# Methodology

We provided data for each police force area in the UK, sourced through requests made under the Freedom of Information Act (FOI).

To gain the fullest picture we could as to the extent of this issue, the data was not only sourced from the 45 police forces covering the UK, but also through FOI requests to: 

Crown Prosecution Service,
Crown Office & Procurator Fiscal Service, 
The Public Prosecution Service,
Scottish Prison Service,
Northern Ireland Prison Service,
Her Majesty’s Prison & Probation Service,
Her Majesty's Passport Office,
Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency,
Disclosure & Barring Service,
Driver & Vehicle Agency,
Disclosure Scotland,
Access Northern Ireland,
Home Office and National Police Chiefs Council.

NB Notes on the data 

Some of the police forces highlighted limitations in the data they could provide in their FOI responses and gave a snapshot of the figures on the dates of our original FOI requests from live systems.  Please read the notes in each row for the forces’ data you are using to understand any necessary caveats. 


# What we found 

-	Hundreds of registered sex offenders (729) had either been recorded by police as having gone missing or were wanted for arrest in the previous three complete financial years - 31 of the 45 police forces covering the UK were able to provide those data
- At least 1,457 registered sex offenders had notified police forces of name changes/aliases in the past three financial years - 21 of the 45 police forces covering the UK were able to provide those data
- The Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS) found 2,190 applicants for checks had criminal records and they had supplied incorrect or missed out personal details such as past names or aliases
- There had been 5,518 offences committed by registered sex offenders of failing to comply with notification requirements in the previous three complete financial years. 
- Those offences could have included, but were not limited to: not notifying police of a name change/intention to travel abroad or within the UK/not notifying police of a change of address or circumstances such as beginning to live in a household with a child under the age of 18. 32 of the 45 police forces covering the UK were able to provide those data
- 6740 prosecutions had begun for offences by registered sex offenders of breaches of a sexual harm prevention order/interim order/foreign travel order in England and Wales in the same previous three complete financial years
- There were at least 66,139 registered sex offenders living in the UK, according to latest figures at that time, which 43 out of the 45 police forces were able to provide
- Prison services across the UK were unable to answer under FOI how many sex offenders had changed their name while in prison in the previous three complete financial years
- HM Passport Office could not answer under FOI how many times it had contacted individual police forces when any sex offenders on their watch list, also known as the “stop list” or “browse”, had applied for new passports or to change their personal details
- Both the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency, which covers Great Britain, and Northern Ireland’s Driver & Vehicle Agency would neither confirm nor deny they held data on how many times checks of new applications for driving licences had revealed the applicants had criminal records and had supplied incorrect or false details in the previous three complete financial years. They said to confirm or deny those data were held, might risk an increase in fraudulent or false applications
- National Records of Scotland said in its FOI response to us it “did not hold details of name changes made by deed poll or statutory declaration”. The General Register Office, which covers England and Wales, said it did not hold records of change of name, as did the National Archives. The Deed Poll Records team at the Royal Courts of Justice in London said it did “not manage a breakdown numbers of name changes by police force area, we simply enroll the change of name applications completed by the applicants…” and it did “however check for particular change of name for specific year when DPA request had been received”
